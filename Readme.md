LED Cube Animation Editor
=========================

For creating LED Cube animations for a 4x4x4 Cube.

## Using the scripts
Right now you need to manually change the led pins from my pin out to yours, I will work on a localstorage option for saving your pin numbers. PouchDB looks promising.

## Contributing
Help is welcome, do what you want and send in a pull request or whatnot. Things that would be nice to have added include a virtual cube to visualize, frame tracking, UI Improovements, saving animations to a list -- use PouchDB?

## How to edit Arduino Script
For now, open the ino file and make your changes. Run the script through this [site](http://www.freeformatter.com/javascript-escape.htm), and update the app.js variables.
